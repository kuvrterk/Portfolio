What this program does is having a class by the name of student, undergrad, and grad. Student class is the base class and undergrad is the
derived class of student, and grad is the derived class of undergrad.
Student -> undergrad -> Grad

So the program would test some variables to make sure that the student functions is correctly working. Then print out basic information
of students. Undergrad would expand that by inheritaing memebrs from the student class, but having two more unquie members, and the grad 
class would inheritant student and undergrad members.
