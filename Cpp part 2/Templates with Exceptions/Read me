That This program does

This program is simple when it comes down to what it actually does. What it does is taking in different dataypes from the main
file (i.e. int, float, double, short, long, string, char) and depeneing on what the datatpye is it would perform some math. 
For non-number datatype it would short them using the shell sort. 

For number datatype it would find the smallest and largest number, while sorting it as well, then do some math. From finding the mean,
average, sum, standard devi, and finally print the results. lastly it would have the user input a number for the length of what the array
would be and perform the same operations.

1. Making the class with the set datatype
2. call the constructor 
3. Call all the functions within the class
4. print the results

class w/ double -> call constructor -> call the math functions -> shell sort -> print the results -> call destructor
class w/ char -> call constructor -> shell sort -> print the results -> call destructor
